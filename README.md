# build-HMM-
This project describe the procedure to build a method for automatical classification of a protein family. Indeed, we made an Profile-HMM based on the Kunitz proteins (Pfam:PF00014) that are serine proteases inhibitors, using  HMMER programs. The model allow us to predicted which protein can consider as Kunitz proteins. Its results are reliable in a specific E-value range, that is been found by testing its performance at different E-value threshold.

You can follow all the single steps on the file called Profile-HMM.sh
