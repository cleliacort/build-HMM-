# build-HMM-
The project describe the procedure to build a Profile Hidden Markov Model able to predict the presence of the Kunitz domain in a
sequence. The predictor is trained using a set of Kunitz proteins (Pfam ID:PF0014) which are structurally
similar. We tested the predictor using two benchmark sets from which we derived statical informations to
evaluate in which E-value range it is able to do its optimal performance. The final results are supported
by two statical coefficients: the Accuracy Coefficient and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient.
